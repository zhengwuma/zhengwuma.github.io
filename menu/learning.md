Hi there! 

Thanks for visiting.

I was born in [Pingliang](https://www.trip.com/travel-guide/destination/pingliang-424/), Gansu, Northwestern China. It is slightly different from the primary cities in China due to the blend of Taoism, Islam, and Buddhism. And I always believe this silk-road city is the most beautiful place in the world. 

When I was six, my parents and I moved to [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an), the ancient capital of 13 dynasties. I stayed there all the way through primary school, high school, and even undergrad at Xi’an Jiaotong University. Sometimes I joke that staying in one city for so long sounds boring, but honestly, Jiaotong gave me everything I needed and a lot of room to grow. I’m especially proud to be an alumna of [The High School Affiliated to Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xajdfz.com.cn/).

I took German in 7th and 8th grade, and somehow "Deutsch" still comes to mind before "German"—same with "biologie" instead of "biology." Oddly enough, I didn’t have the same problem with Spanish at XJTU or Italian during my exchange semester in Madison. I started learning linguistics as a sophomore exchange student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I believe many students have heard about the course [LINGUIS 101/301](https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/linguis/), which is also the beginning of everything for me.  

After the memorable learning experience during COVID, I returned to XJTU to finish my B.A. under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaopeng Zhang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhangxp). In his lab, I got to run eye-tracking experiments, collect data, and dive into statistical analysis... In 2022, I joined CityU and was lucky enough to meet [Dr. Jixing Li](https://jixing-li.github.io/). Now I’m one of the founding members of the LAMB Lab.

Another part of my language learning journey is closely tied to music. Thanks to my mom and my three-year-old self, I started piano lessons at a very young age and kept at it for four years.  In primary school, I also studied violin and took vocal training (I’m pretty sure my mom was secretly hoping I’d end up at a music conservatory). I completed all the graded exams for a traditional Chinese instrument, [cucurbit flute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUvh4xTID5s), which is her favorite.

This is Zhengwu Ma, she/her.&ensp;È©¨Ê≠£Âçà&ensp;[d í…ôÃÄ≈ã «î m«é]

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at [LAMB Lab](https://compneurolinglab.github.io/), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by [Dr. Jixing Li](https://jixing-li.github.io/). Before that, I got my B.A. in English from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Xiaopeng Zhang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhangxp).

Now I am focusing on applying computational models to understand how the human brain represents and computes semantic information during language comprehension.

I am the 1st-year PhD student at the LAnguages, Machines & Brains Lab, CityU, advised by [Prof. Jixing Li](https://jixing-li.github.io/). Before that, I got my B.A. in English from XJTU, advised by [Prof. Xiaopeng Zhang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhangxp). I am focusing on applying computational models to understand how the human brain represents and computes semantic information during language comprehension.

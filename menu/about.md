Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the LAnguages, Machines & Brains Lab, CityU, supervised by [Dr. Jixing Li](https://jixing-li.github.io/). Before that, I got my B.A. in English from XJTU, supervised by [Prof. Xiaopeng Zhang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhangxp). Now I am focusing on applying computational models to understand how the human brain represents and computes semantic information during language comprehension.

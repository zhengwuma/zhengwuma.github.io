This is Zhengwu Ma.   È©¨Ê≠£Âçà

Currently, I am the master student in Linguistics at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by [Dr. Jixing Li](https://jixing-li.github.io/). 

Prior to that, I got my B.A. in English, Linguistics specialization from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Xiaopeng Zhang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhangxp).



## Research Interest

Now I am focusing on studying the language comprehension. By using quantitative approaches and computational models to understand how human brain process and compute the language information. This is also the topic of my master project. 

I am also interested in the speech language, such as how we perceive and comprehend the sounds signals. I did several works on the spoken language machine assessment during undergraduate phase.

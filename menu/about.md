This is Zhengwu Ma, she/her.&ensp;È©¨Ê≠£Âçà&ensp;[ à Ç…§≈ãÀã uÀá maÀá]

Currently, I am the master student in Linguistics at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by [Dr. Jixing Li](https://jixing-li.github.io/). I am also the member of the [LAMB Lab](https://compneurolinglab.github.io/).

Prior to that, I got my B.A. in English, Linguistics Specialization, from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Xiaopeng Zhang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhangxp).



## Research Interest

Now I am focusing on studying language comprehension using quantitative approaches and computational models to understand how the human brain processes and computes language information. It is also the topic of my master's project.  

I am also interested in speech-language, such as how we perceive and comprehend sounds signals. I did several works on the spoken language machine assessment during the undergraduate phase.

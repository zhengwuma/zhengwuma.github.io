Hi there! I'm Zhengwu.

Thanks for visiting.

I was born in [Pingliang](https://www.trip.com/travel-guide/destination/pingliang-424/), Gansu, Northwestern China. It is slightly different from the primary cities in China due to the blend of Taoism, Islam, and Buddism. And I always believe this silk-road small town is the most beautiful place in the world. 

When I was six, I moved to [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an), Shaanxi, China. In this ancient capital for more than 13 dynasties, I finished my primary school, high school and even the undergraduate in the Jiaotong University. 

Even though always stay in one place is "boring" sometime, Jiaotong is really the good place where feed me everything.

I started to learn Linguistics when I was the sophomore exchange student in UW-Madison. I believe lots of the students have taken the course LINGUIS 101/303, and this is also the beginning of everything for me. 

After the special leanring experience during COVID, I returned to XJTU to finish my B.A. under the supervision of Prof. Xiaopeng Zhang. 

In his team, I operated the eye-tracking experiments, collecting the data, learned the statistical analysis... That is the place transformed me from the blank.

In 2022, I entered City University of Hong Kong. Extremely lucky to meet my current supervisor Dr. Jixing Li. She led me to touch the computational-neurolinguistics. There is this kind of fascinating way to study language!

Hope you guys enjoy the visiting!

Zhengwu

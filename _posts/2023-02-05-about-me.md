Hi there! 

Thanks for visiting.

I was born in [Pingliang](https://www.trip.com/travel-guide/destination/pingliang-424/), Gansu, Northwestern China. It is slightly different from the primary cities in China due to the blend of Taoism, Islam, and Buddhism. And I always believe this silk-road city is the most beautiful place in the world. 

When I was six, I moved to [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an), Shaanxi, with my parents. In this ancient capital of China for more than 13 dynasties, I finished my primary school, high school, and even my undergraduate in Jiaotong University.  

Even though staying in one place is "boring" sometimes, Jiaotong is really a good place to feed me everything. And I am proud to be the alumna of [The High School Affiliated to Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xajdfz.com.cn/). 

I learned two-year German in grades 7 and 8, which still annoys me to say "German" as "Deutsch." Weirdly, this hard-to-switch problem did not happen when I studied Spanish in XJTU, and Italian in Madison.

I started learning linguistics as a sophomore exchange student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I believe many students have heard about the course [LINGUIS 101/301](https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/linguis/), which is also the beginning of everything for me.  

After the memorable learning experience during COVID, I returned to XJTU to finish my B.A. under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaopeng Zhang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhangxp). 

In his team, I operated the eye-tracking experiments, collected the data, learned the statistical analysis... That is the place that transformed me from the blank.

In 2022, I entered the City University of Hong Kong, and luckily to meet my current supervisor [Dr. Jixing Li](https://jixing-li.github.io/). She led me to taste the field of computational neurolinguistics. There is this fascinating way to study language!

Hope you guys enjoy the visit!

Zhengwu
